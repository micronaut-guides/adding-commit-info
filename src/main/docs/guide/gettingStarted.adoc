In this guide we are going to add git commit info to your Micronaut build artifacts and running application. There are many benefits of keeping your commit info handy:

* Commit info is encapsulated within the built artifacts

* Fast authoritative means of identifying what specific code is running in an environment

* This solution doesn't rely on external tracking mechanisms

* Transparency and reproducibility when investigating issues
